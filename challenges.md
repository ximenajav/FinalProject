## What difficulties did you face?

The difficulties we faced surrounded the use of turtles. We had some trouble figuring out the exact angle measurements needed to move different parts of each boat. Another challenge we faced was remember that Python counts from 0 not 1, so we ran into some difficulties when setting the range. 

## What difficulties did you overcome?

The difficulties we overcame were figuring out the exact angle measurements needed in order to have our images function properly as well as applying for loops. We also were able to figure out how to incorporate different fonts in our game to give it that creative and unique factor. 

## What are the things you learned?

We feel that this project was extremely beneficial in our learning process. We learned how to incorporate different modules of the class into one project, specifically turtles and for loops. Moreover, we learned that even if there are obstacles that we face throughout our project, it is okay and a normal process of coding. Lastly, we were able to learn how to time manage by splitting this project into four parts to eliminate stress and to focus on each section so that it could function properly while also being unique. 

## What did you enjoy?

We enjoyed the artistic opportunity that we had in designing the various images produced by turtles. We were extremely happy to be able to incorporate our acquired knowledge to this project while also being able to have fun with it. Lastly, we enjoyed actually seeing the game work and the feeling that we got when the code ran with no errors gave us confidence in using Python. 

As much as we enjoyed completing this project, we hope you enjoyed viewing it! Thank you so much!
